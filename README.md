# Week4Challenge

What was the challenge?

The challenge was to build a calculator.

How I expected the challenge to go.

I expected the challenge to go well because I've done some object oriented programming before but was a little unsure because I've not done any projects using Javascript. 

What went well?

It was good to work through the logic and build on my skills.
  
What didn't go as planned?
  
The further into the build I got the more complex the code became. The calculator has all the functions working but could have more functionality added. After one calculation has been done the user would need to press the 'C' button to start a new calculation, I didn't implement a way for the user to use the previous result in a  new calculation without having to start over.

Possible improvements for future challenge.

In future challenges I think I would search the documentation and online for functions that can be used to make the code simpler and have more functionality. However, I purposely didn't search for any functions in this challenge to try and work on my logic using everything that we've been taught.
